Miners earn emissions by depositing TAO into the WTAO contract.
Miners can remove TAO at any time. The scoring logic and funds are 100% isolated by design.
(we use WTAO as Phase 1 will allow WTAO deposits/withdrawals into the mixer)

Miners must associate the H160 address they make the deposit with registered ss58-hk (DepositTracker)
Once an H160 is associated to a ss58-hk, the H160 cannot be reassigned. To change the HK or H160, you must withdraw and make a new deposit + association. (hopefully this changes in the EVM in the future)

Weights are calculated entirely on-chain (a bittensor first?)

It's recommended to familiarize yourself with a local evm instance (making deposits/withdrawals between H160/ss58 addresses) before using real funds.

You only need to run this script once per miner HK. Afterwards you can use deposit/withdrawal scripts to manage funds.

p.s. please read the above before mining. üå™Ô∏è
